## 🚫 Problem Statement
The apparel and tailoring ecosystem involving customers, designers, tailors, and fabric merchants operates in a highly fragmented manner. Each stakeholder functions independently, relying on informal communication, manual coordination, and disconnected workflows.

**Key Pain Points:**
*   **Design Misinterpretation**: Customers struggle to translate ideas; tailors face ambiguity.
*   **Inefficient Collaboration**: disconnected workflows between designers and tailors.
*   **Material Mismatches**: Fabric merchants lack visibility into actual demand, causing waste.
*   **Operational Inefficiency**: Repeated alterations, delays, and lack of tracking.
*   **No Data Traceability**: Absence of scalable growth models or analytics.

There is currently no unified digital platform that connects all stakeholders into a single, transparent, and structured workflow.
